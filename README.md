# Mushroom Edibility Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its features. This repository contains a Streamlit web application, a machine learning model training pipeline, and a presentation explaining the project.

## Features

Interactive Web App: Users can input mushroom attributes and get predictions on edibility.

Machine Learning Models: Compares Random Forest, SVC, and Gradient Boosting models with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales features.

Visualization: Displays model performance metrics using bar charts for comparison.

## Dataset

The project uses the Mushroom Dataset from OpenML, which contains 22 features describing mushroom characteristics (e.g., cap shape, odor, habitat) and a target variable indicating whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous.

##  Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

##  Tools & Libraries
